          March 2020: Received an offer for an engineering role at LinkedIn the
          day before they announced their hiring freeze. Better luck next time.

          July 2019: Began attending a coding bootcamp to brush up on my coding
          skills. I left after realizing that I already knew more than I
          realized and figured I'd learn even more working on the startup. I
          created a framework for my own learning curriculum, recruited some
          mentors, and never looked back.

          June 2019: Co-founded a start-up called Happy at Home with Rich Pappas
          and Hal Woods, and began work on our flagship product, Advo.

          January 2019: Earned a master's in occupational therapy and began
          working as a pediatric OT. In addition to my work as a therapist, I
          act as tech support for my co-workers. I also built our company
          website and I'm working on building an online tool to streamline our
          evaluation process.

          May 2015: Graduated from Pomona College with a degree in International
          Relations. I wrote my thesis on strategies to combat human
          trafficking. This began my dreams of createing technological solutions
          to solve human problems. I was torn between going into a healthcare
          role where I could help people directly or continuing to pursue and
          interest in technology. After much deliberation I decided that I
          wanted to do both, but it made sense to pursue formal education in the
          field of Occupational Therapy. It turns out that you can build
          software without being a licensed practitioner, but not so much for
          healthcare.

          January 2013: I founded my first company, Craft Change. It still
          exists today as an outlet for my art and a way to support causes I
          care about. This company was also the beginning of my long-term love
          of programming. I first started styling divs building the Craft Change
          website in Wordpress.

          May 2011: I graduated high school as valedictorian with the school
          science award in tow after being told for four years by my teachers
          that girls can't do math or science. I've outgrown the chip on my
          shoulder, but I do hope to one day return home to start a program for
          middle and high school girls who are interested in STEM. I don't think
          it would've taken me so long to find software engineering if I'd had
          the same opportunity.
